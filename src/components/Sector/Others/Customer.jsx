      <h3>
        Customers are demanding that banks provide the same customer experience
        as their insurers, retailers, and social media. Millennials are highly
        influenced by their family and friends and are twice as likely to
        transact online. To overcome these challenges while maintaining brand
        image requires IT to deliver highly available systems on stable,
        compliant platforms. New FinTech entrants are raising the bar on
        technology expectations, driving new, competitive services at an
        accelerated rate.
