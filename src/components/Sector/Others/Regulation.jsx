        Security is a top priority for banks, yet an insufficient amount of an
        IT budget is typically dedicated to information security. Investments in
        the right technology allow banks to not only avoid breaches but also
        quickly remediate threats. New business models promoting global best
        practices require significant changes to many banksâ€™ current operating
        models. IT must be prepared to meet these requirements so focus can
        return to more strategic initiatives.
